        <h1>Basic HyperText Markup language Animals</h1>

        <p>
            This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.

        <h2>The Llama</h2>

        <p>
            Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
        </p>

        <h2>The Ananconda</h2>

        <p>
            The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
