        Why Are Cats So Cute?
    </h1>

    <p>
        Scientists theorize that the reason cats are so cute is because of their facial appearance and their underlying structure.

        People are evolutionarily wired to find faces with large eyes and a large head irresistible – a biological phenomenon called the “baby schema” according to <a href="https://www.popsci.com/why-do-we-think-tiny-things-are-cute/">Pop Science.</a>
