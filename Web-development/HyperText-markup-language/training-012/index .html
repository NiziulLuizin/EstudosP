        <h1>Important notice</h1>
        <p>
            On <strong>Sunday January 9th 2010</strong>, a gang of goths were
            spotted <strong>stealing</strong> several <em>garden gnomes</em> from a
            shopping center in <strong>downtown Milwaukee</strong>. They were
            all wearing green jumpsuits and silly hats, and
            seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone
            has any <strong>information</strong> about this <strong>incident</strong>, please
            <em>contact the police</em> now.
        </p>
